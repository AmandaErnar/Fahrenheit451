    <h2>Fire, heat, and light</h2>
    <p class="container">
In Fahrenheit 451 Fire, Heat, and light are symbols for two main purposes. Through the firemen wearing 451 on their helmets, fire symbolizes destruction. 451 degrees fahrenheit is the temperature that paper and books burn. Clarisse reminds Montag of Candle- light and how when fire is controlled it can symbolize the flickering of self-awareness and internal knowledge of all life. 

The light symbolizes how Clarisse's sudden appearance in Montag's life is a light, a light that brings Montag a way out of the darkness.

    <h2>The Phoenix</h2>
    <p class="container">
Of the biggest symbols of Fahrenheit 451 was The Phoenix. The Phoenix is a bird that is consumed by fire but then rises from the ashes. It is a symbol for renewal and rebirth. After the city is reduced to ashes by bombers in Fahrenheit 451, Granger makes a direct connection to human beings and the story of The Phoenix. They both destroy themselves in fire, but then rise from the ashes once again.

    <h2>Insects, bugs, etc.</h2>
    <p class="container">
        We think of these things to be annoying. In Fahrenheit 451, these things represent government control. Most insects are incredibly tiny and can make their way into your house. In the book, the government has its ways of accessing your personal information.
