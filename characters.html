    <h3>Guy Montag</h3>
    <img src="img/montag.jpg">
    <p>He indulges in literature out of curiosity despite social and legal pressure. His curiosity deepens as a certain emptiness within him grows, when a strange girl moves next door and a woman sacrifices herself for her books. When the question, "What makes you happy?" is asked, Montag is sent into a whirl of anxiety, realizing that something is missing in his life, something that strays from the twenty-fourth century ideal of distraction and passivity.</p>
    <p>When a woman willingly burns along with her books in the hands of Montag and the other firemen, it makes him wonder: what could possibly be in these books to make an individual do such a thing? And so, his journey begins. He hides a book in his home but cannot quite understand it well enough due to society wiring his brain to mindlessly glare at television screens and listen intently to senseless propaganda.</p>
    <p>At home, his wife, Mildred, comments on Montag seeming to not love her anymore. In fact, he cannot remember how the pair even met to being with.</p>

    <h3>Mildred Montag</h3>
    <img src="img/mildred.jpg">
    <p> Mildred is Guy's wife. She has an unhealthy addiction to tranquilizers and overdoses every once in a while. Every time, officials wipe her memory so that she cannot remember ever taking the tranquilizers to begin with. She is not a very bright woman, perhaps because she grew up with TV parlors and seashells whispering propaganda into her ears. Her friends do not seem to understand the problems and political climate of their day, only gossiping about characters on television screens and stressing the importance of not being sad or hurt in any shape or form. She is willing to sacrifice Montag's wellbeing for her vanity.

    <h3>Captain Beatty</h3>
    <img src="img/beatty.jpg">
    <p>Personally, my favorite character, despite him being the central antagonist of the story. He does not put up with nonsense and obviously has had quite a history. He often drones on about the importance of society getting along with one another. He claims to believe that ideas are dangerous and that they ought to be vanquished because of their controversial nature. This can be tied back to our current world's social media companies flagging and shoving certain posts under the rug to prevent them from causing conflicts.</p>
