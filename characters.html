    <h2>Characters</h2>    
    <h3>Guy Montag</h3>
    <img src="img/montag.jpg">
    <div class="container">
         <p>He indulges in literature out of curiosity despite social and legal pressure. His curiosity deepens as a certain emptiness within him grows, when a strange girl moves next door and a woman sacrifices herself for her books. When the question, "What makes you happy?" is asked, Montag is sent into a whirl of anxiety, realizing that something is missing in his life, something that strays from the twenty-fourth century ideal of distraction and passivity.</p>
        <p>When a woman willingly burns along with her books in the hands of Montag and the other firemen, it makes him wonder: what could possibly be in these books to make an individual do such a thing? And so, his journey begins. He hides a book in his home but cannot quite understand it well enough due to society wiring his brain to mindlessly glare at television screens and listen intently to senseless propaganda.</p>
        <p>At home, his wife, Mildred, comments on Montag seeming to not love her anymore. In fact, he cannot remember how the pair even met to begin with.</p>
    </div>
    </br>
    <h3>Mildred Montag</h3>
    <img src="img/mildred.jpg">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Mildred is Guy's wife. She has an unhealthy addiction to tranquilizers and overdoses every once in a while. Every time, officials wipe her memory so that she cannot remember ever taking the tranquilizers to begin with.</p>
        <p>She is not a very bright woman, perhaps because she grew up with TV parlors and seashells whispering propaganda into her ears. Her friends do not seem to understand the problems and political climate of their day, only gossiping about characters on television screens and stressing the importance of not being sad or hurt in any shape or form.</p>
        <p>She is willing to sacrifice Montag's wellbeing for a piece of toast.</p>
    </div>
    </br>
    <h3>Clarisse McClellan</h3>
    <img src="img/clarisse.jpg">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Clarisse is an innocent, down-to-earth person that indulges in hobbies seen as "weird" in their society, such as hiking, picking flowers, telling jokes, etc.</p>
    <p>Clarisse was the individual who encouraged Montag to step out of his comfort zone and try to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, like stars and sunsets. She introduced to him the idea that there is so much more to life than burning books and getting rid of ideas. She points him towards caving into his curiosity. Unlike the other members of society, she's alive. At her high school, the other kids are taught how to repair and work a television rather than science and other important subjects.</p>
    <p>A thing that sets Clarisse apart from everyone else is that she slows things down and really takes the time for the moment to infuse. She notices small things, like the man on the moon and the fact that there is dew on the grass. She smiles and puts together natural wreaths to hang on Montag's door. She's lively.</p>
    </div>
    </br>
    <h3>Captain Beatty</h3>
    <img src="img/beatty.jpg">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Personally, he's my favorite character, despite him being the central antagonist of the story. He does not put up with nonsense and obviously has had quite a history. He often drones on about the importance of society getting along with one another. He claims to believe that ideas are dangerous and that they ought to be vanquished because of their controversial nature. This can be tied back to our current world's social media companies flagging and shoving certain posts under the rug to prevent them from causing conflicts.</p>
    <p>Towards the end of the novel, Beatty kills himself by giving Montag a flamethrower, though it isn't implied explicitly. This showed his old passion for books, of which he often quoted from. Maybe something went wrong in his life, which encouraged to become a book-burner.</p>
    </div>
    </br>
    <h3>Professor Faber</h3>
    <img src="img/faber.jpg">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Professor Faber used to be a professor at a prestigious university, now retired. He is a guide to Montag and helps him navigate the world of literature. He communicates with Montag via a seashell earbud, causing an upset in the Montags' home when Mildred invites her friends over. The pair discuss plans to destroy the firemen's system from the inside out.</p>
    <p>Faber claims to have issues with commitment and admits to being scared to "make a move" and instead sits at home, cowardly, waiting for something to happen. This is why he probably views the arrival of Montag in his life to be some sort of blessing.</p>
