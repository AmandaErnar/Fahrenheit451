    <h3 class="container" style="height:15%">This novel in particular is relevant to today's society because of the chilling parallels it draws between technology and the dystopian world.</h3>
    <h3>Television Parlors</h3>
    </br>
    <p class="container" style="height: 20%">
        The most prominent device in the book is the TV parlor, which is basically a room with three of its walls consisting of broad television screens. The purpose of this device is to provide entertainment to individuals. This would remind you of the cellphones we use today that keep ourselves entertained. Though, the civilians in this novel have their eyes practically glued to the screens of their home parlors. The screens don't even play movies or anything due to the average citizen's attention span being unable to hold for more than thirty seconds. They usually play short nonsense that doesn't even make sense.
    </p>
    <h3>Taking it Slow</h3>
    <p class="container" style="height:20%">One concept that really captured my attention in this novel is the fact that the government systematically encourages civilians to remain distracted. For example, you are not allowed to drive slower than 55 mph. This keeps your attention span short. Media and big tech in the present day encourages you to stay on and remain preoccupied. Shorts, reels, and TikToks are progressively getting shorter because of our shortening attention spans. It's Clarisse who points out the strangeness of this, who actually slows down and pays attention to things like morning dew and the man in the moon. It's weird, how this one novel predicted the way society was headed.</p>
    <h3>Sobriety vs. Pleasure</h3>
    <p class="container" style="height:20%;">The juxtaposition that struck me the hardest was Faber and Beatty's conflicting ideologies. Faber suggested that ideas, though dangerous, play a major role in the progression of society. Beatty stressed the peril and violence caused by thoughts and opinions. He believed that people ought to be in a constant state of happiness. Getting taught about racism and poverty and such would interfere with that. Mildred's friends couldn't take hearing sad poetry because society sheltered them from feeling anything.</p>
    <h3>Sacrificing Livelihoods for Control</h3>
    <p class="container" style="height:20%">Another things would be that major concepts vital to humanity's overall identity, like religion, were being used as marketing tools to advertise TV programs and other stuff. Christmas, a tradition lasing at least a millennia, was used as a marketing device to keep people distracted.</p>
